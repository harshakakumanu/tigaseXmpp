When your JAVA_HOME path is properly set, it will be auto-detected saving you some configuration time. If you are reading this step and still don&#8217;t have JDK installed, then go back to the ////&lt;&lt;prequisites,////prerequisites section where you can find some info on how to prepare your system for Tigase installation. Sometimes your system will be configured in a way that prevents detection of JDK path. This often happens when you install JRE after installing JDK. You will have to find JDK directory yourself.  It is by default installed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Program Files\Java</strong></span> directory of your system drive.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_installation_type_selection"></a>Installation Type Selection</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winInstall3.gif" alt="winInstall3"></span></p><p>Recommended practice is to choose both installation and configuration of the server as manual configuration is more complicated, time consuming and error-prone.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_introduction_to_the_server"></a>Introduction To the Server</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winInstall4.gif" alt="winInstall4"></span></p><p>This screen shows some information about Tigase which may help you understand what it is and how it can help to take advantage of the <span class="strong"><strong>XMPP</strong></span> protocol. It is important that you read all information&#8217;s appearing on the installer screens, as they contain valuable hints and most recent information.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_choice_of_base_directory"></a>Choice of Base Directory</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winInstall6.gif" alt="winInstall6"></span></p><p>This is the point where you choose where do you want you server to be installed. Recommended path should not contain spaces, as it may be reason of some strange path problems. In the case of installation on Windows it should be installed on a short path because there is a limit of path lengths. Also note that on Windows Vista there may be some problems with making the server work while installed in the Program Files directory, related to the working of UAC mechanism, so better don&#8217;t install it there.  If you don&#8217;t want are unsure about where to place the server, you can always leave the default selection.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_packages_selection"></a>Packages selection</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winInstall7.gif" alt="winInstall7"></span></p><p>Next important step is package selection. Some choices are grey and you cannot change them as they are essential. All of the rest is optional. It consists of documentation, database drivers, sources of the server and some extras. When you select an item, you will be presented with a short description of it&#8217;s content.</p><p>We recommend you to install documentation. It contains valuable resources which may be very helpful in administration and general use of the server.</p><p>If you have a working database platform that you want to use for storing all important user information in, just select appropriate db drivers.  If you don&#8217;t have a database engine, you can use the included derby along with also included drivers.</p><p>If you are a developer and you want to be able to check how the server is working or you want to help with the development, you can install also the included source codes.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_basic_server_configuration"></a>Basic Server Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winInstall13.gif" alt="winInstall13"></span></p><p>On this screen you will find most important basic configuration options. As this guide covers only non-advanced set up - disable the advanced configuration checkbox.</p><p>You can select which components will be installed. For most installations default selection will most appropriate. You can expand the list to check if any of the other options will better suit your needs.</p><p>It is very important that you enter your domain name correctly here.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">On <span class="strong"><strong>Linux</strong></span> like system you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>hostname</strong></span> command and extract the domain part from the output. If you use the <span class="strong"><strong>-f</strong></span> parameter then you will get the fully qualified domain name.</li><li class="listitem">On <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> use the standard <span class="strong"><strong>System</strong></span> control panel applet. You will find your domain (computer name) in the <span class="strong"><strong>Computer name</strong></span> tab.</li></ul></div><p>On the other hand if you want to use Tigase virtual domain support and you have your <span class="strong"><strong>DNS</strong></span> system configured properly, then you can put your virtual domains list here. Just separate them by comma characters. For example if your server is seen from the outside as <span class="strong"><strong>veloci.tigase.org,</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>mammoth.tigase.org</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>tigase.org</strong></span> then you can use Tigase instance as if it were three separate instances.  In reality it will be one server, however <span class="strong"><strong>admin@veloci.tigase.org</strong></span> will be a different user then <span class="strong"><strong>admin@tigase.org.</strong></span> This feature allows to use one server for separating user groups, for example different organizations.</p><p>When you will have your domain name just enter it in the domain text box. Next parameter will be the JID of server administrator. Standard practice is to give him name of <span class="strong"><strong>admin</strong></span>, however you may choose any name you like. For example for domain <span class="strong"><strong>tigase.org</strong></span> full admin name would be <span class="strong"><strong>admin@tigase.org.</strong></span> Just stick your chosen name and domain together using the @ character as separator.</p><p>Starting from this version your XMPP admin will be automatically added to the database, so after installation you can just login into the server without registering admin manually.</p><p>You should also select a database which will be used for storing user info. Default is the <span class="strong"><strong>Derby</strong></span> database, if you don&#8217;t need anything special just leave it as it is. Just select a new password as the default one may be easy to guess for a hacker.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Important notice: Tigase installer doesn&#8217;t contain the actual databases, only drivers allowing db access. One exception is Derby database, which is included in JDK. It is automatically configured by installer, in case of other databases you will need to configure them by yourself.</strong></span></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_verification_of_database_connection_and_performing_db_tasks"></a>Verification of Database Connection and Performing DB Tasks</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winInstall20.gif" alt="winInstall20"></span></p><p>When you switch to this screen an automatic test of database configuration will be started. It consists of few steps which will be executed in order. After testing connection and configuring schema, admin users will be added.</p><p>What to do if any of the tests will fail?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">If you decided to use your own database, check if you entered correct password and whether your database is running.</li><li class="listitem">If you use the embedded <span class="strong"><strong>Derby</strong></span> database then probably your problem is more complicated.

They are briefly presented below.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_running_the_server"></a>Running the Server</h3></div></div></div><p>Part of the installation process is selection of Tigase base directory. This is where you can find all important server files. Installer will create some configurable shortcuts in the <span class="strong"><strong>Start Menu</strong></span>. You can navigate to the menu and use it to start the server.   To run the server manually:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">On a <span class="strong"><strong>Linux</strong></span> system you may start the server using the <span class="strong"><strong>tigase.sh</strong></span> file found in the <span class="strong"><strong>scripts</strong></span> sub-directory of Tigase server base directory. In the root server directory type the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">./scripts/tigase.sh start etc/tigase.conf</pre></li><li class="listitem">Of course if you have a custom config file then change last command appropriately.</li><li class="listitem">On a <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> platform you can use a <span class="strong"><strong>bat</strong></span> file to run the server. There is a <span class="strong"><strong>run.bat</strong></span> file in the Tigase root directory. Just double click it in <span class="strong"><strong>Explorer</strong></span> or run it from command line to start the server. A window with server log output will pop-up.</li></ul></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="./images/winRun.gif" alt="winRun"></span></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_installation_as_a_service"></a>Installation as a Service</h3></div></div></div><p>On <span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span> you can install Tigase as a service. To do it use the <span class="strong"><strong>InstallTigaseService.bat</strong></span> batch file found also in server root directory.</p><p>In this mode service will be running in background and will be controllable from the <span class="strong"><strong>Services</strong></span> management snapshot. To launch the tool right click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Computer</strong></span> icon on the desktop. Choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Manage</strong></span> action. It will run the <span class="strong"><strong>Computer management</strong></span> graphical configuration program. On the left side choose the <span class="strong"><strong>Services</strong></span> item.  You will be shown with a list of services. Here you can find Tigase service when it will be installed.</p><p>To uninstall Tigase service use the <span class="strong"><strong>UninstallTigaseService.bat</strong></span> file from Tigase server root directory.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_how_to_check_if_the_server_is_running"></a>How to Check if the Server is Running</h3></div></div></div><p>Checking if the server is running is quite easy.
