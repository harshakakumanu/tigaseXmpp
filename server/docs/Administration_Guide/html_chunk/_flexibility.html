The most obvious are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">Used as bussiness communication platform in small and medium companies server is not under heavy load. Instead for such deployments security is a key feature.</li><li class="listitem">Fo huge community websites or internet portals server is on the other side usually under very heavy load and have to support tousands or millions of simultaneous connections and for such deployment we talk about different kind of security as the service is open to public anyway.</li><li class="listitem">For very small community deployments or for small home networks the key factor is ease to deploy and maintain.</li></ul></div><p>Architecture based on components allows you to run selected modules on separate machines so the server can be easily applied to all scenarios.</p><p>For simple installation server generates config file which can be used almost stright away with very few modifications or sometimes even no config editing is required. For complex deployments though you can tweak configuration to your needs and setup Jabber server on as many physical machines as you need.
Extensibility</p><p>The world changes all the time so people needs change as well. Jabber/XMPP protocol has been designed to be extensible to make it easy adding new features and apply it to different needs. As a result Jabber is a very effective platform not only for sending messages to mates. It can also be extended for sending instant notifications about events, it can be useful platform for on-line customer service, voice communication and all other cases where sending information instantly to other people is needed.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Tigase server</strong></span> has been designed to be extensible as well. Of course modular architecture makes it extensible as you can easily replace component which doesn&#8217;t fullfill your requirements with another one better fitting your needs. But this is not all. Another factor of extensibility is how easy is to replace component or add new extensions. The great focus has been put in server design API to make it easy for other software developers to create extensions and implement new features.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="_about_tigase_jabber_xmpp_server.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="_about_tigase_jabber_xmpp_server.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="_easy.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;About Tigase Jabber/XMPP Server&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Easy</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
